# e-commerce-app

This application is intended to allow ecommerce companies to organize, view, create, and delete various products and categories of goods.

## Description
This website was created with my knowledge of ORM using squelize, mysql, and insomnia core to create a backend application that will serve an ecommerce client. The largest factors of sucess for me in this project was the implementation of api routes which have proved to be the most challenging part of the back end for me.

## Usage
This application allows an ecommerce client to run the application, then make Get, Post, Put, and Delete requests on the seeded data. By entering the appropriate api url the client can gather all products, tags, and categories, or choose to find a specific one using an id. They also have the option of updating or deleting one of these values using the id as well.

## Conclusion
Durning my creation of this webpage I have learned and sharpened many of my coding skills. These skills include:

* Refining my skills using MYSQL, seeds, and mySQL workbench.

* Re-enfocing my skills using sequalize to better manage databases.

* I acheieved a better understanding of api routes and how to create and call Get, Post, Put, and Delete requests.

* Expanded my knowledge of models and how to organize them to work with your routes.

* Gained a greater appriciation for Insomnia.
